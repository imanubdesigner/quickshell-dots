# NOTE: an on-switch thumbnail pre-warm used to live here. Removed deliberately —
# it ran concurrently with the user opening the picker and STOLE cores from the
# picker's own on-demand thumbnailer (ImageCarouselPanel.ensureThumb, nice -10),
# making the first open SLOWER, not faster. Measured: opening 11×8K tiles took
# 2110ms with no warm vs 2713ms while a gentle -P3 warm ran. ensureThumb already
# generates exactly the visible tiles with full core headroom, so any background
# warm here is net-negative. The real fix for cold-theme decode cost is an IDLE
# global pre-warm (all themes, -P nproc, when nothing else runs) — not on-switch.
